9) For the given relation schema: employee(employee-name, street, city)
works (employee-name, company-name, salary)
company (company-name, city)
manages (employee-name, manager-name)
Give an expression in SQL for each of the following queries:
a) Find the name of the company that has the smallest payroll.
b) Find the names of all employees in the database who live in the same cities and on the
same streets as do their managers.
Certainly! Let's first create the tables and then add some sample values. After that, we'll provide
the SQL expressions for the queries.
**Creating Tables:**
```sql
-- Create employee table
CREATE TABLE employee (
 employee_name VARCHAR(50),
 street VARCHAR(100),
 city VARCHAR(50)
);
-- Create works table
CREATE TABLE works (
 employee_name VARCHAR(50),
 company_name VARCHAR(50),
 salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
-- Create company table
CREATE TABLE company (
 company_name VARCHAR(50),
 city VARCHAR(50)
);
-- Create manages table
CREATE TABLE manages (
 employee_name VARCHAR(50),
 manager_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```
**Adding Sample Values:**
```sql
-- Insert sample data into employee table
INSERT INTO employee (employee_name, street, city)
VALUES
 ('John Doe', '123 Main Street', 'New York'),
 ('Jane Smith', '456 Elm Street', 'Los Angeles'),
 ('Bob Johnson', '789 Oak Street', 'Chicago');
-- Insert sample data into works table
INSERT INTO works (employee_name, company_name, salary)
VALUES
 ('John Doe', 'Company A', 12000.00),
 ('Jane Smith', 'Company B', 15000.00),
 ('Bob Johnson', 'Company A', 10000.00);
-- Insert sample data into company table
INSERT INTO company (company_name, city)
VALUES
 ('Company A', 'New York'),
 ('Company B', 'Los Angeles'),
 ('Company C', 'Chicago');
-- Insert sample data into manages table
INSERT INTO manages (employee_name, manager_name)
VALUES
 ('John Doe', 'Jane Smith'),
 ('Jane Smith', 'Bob Johnson');
```
**Queries:**
a) **Find the name of the company that has the smallest payroll:**
```sql
SELECT w.company_name
FROM works w
GROUP BY w.company_name
HAVING SUM(w.salary) = (
 SELECT MIN(total_salary)
 FROM (
 SELECT SUM(salary) as total_salary
 FROM works
 GROUP BY company_name
 ) as min_salaries
);
```
b) **Find the names of all employees who live in the same cities and on the same streets
as do their managers:**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_name
FROM employee e
JOIN manages m ON e.employee_name = m.employee_name
JOIN employee manager ON m.manager_name = manager.employee_name
WHERE e.street = manager.street AND e.city = manager.city;
```
These SQL statements should work with the provided schema and sample data.

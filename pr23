23) Implement Basic SQL queries.
1. Create table employee.
2. Insert 10 records in table.

4. Display name and department of employee working in Manager or Marketing
department
5. Display employees who were hired earliest or latest.

 Predicates
List employees hired in August.
List employees who are hired after 31/12/2006.
Here are the basic SQL queries to implement the tasks you mentioned:
1. Create a table named `employee`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
 emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(50),
 department VARCHAR(50),
 hire_date DATE
);
```
2. Insert 10 records into the `employee` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, name, department, hire_date)
VALUES
 (1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', '2022-01-15'),
 (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Marketing', '2021-11-10'),
 (3, 'Bob Johnson', 'HR', '2022-03-05'),
 (4, 'Alice Brown', 'Marketing', '2020-09-20'),
 (5, 'Charlie Lee', 'Manager', '2019-12-18'),
 (6, 'Eve White', 'Sales', '2021-04-25'),
 (7, 'Frank Black', 'Marketing', '2022-08-30'),
 (8, 'Grace Davis', 'Manager', '2018-07-12'),
 (9, 'Henry Green', 'Sales', '2020-06-02'),
 (10, 'Isabel Reed', 'HR', '2021-02-14');
```
3. Create a view named `emp_vw`:
```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_vw AS
SELECT emp_id, name, department
FROM employee;
```
4. Display the name and department of employees working in the Manager or Marketing
department:
```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employee
WHERE department IN ('Manager', 'Marketing');
```
5. Display employees who were hired earliest or latest:
To display employees hired earliest:
```sql
SELECT name, department, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employee);
```
To display employees hired latest:
```sql
SELECT name, department, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employee);
```
6. Display the name and department number of employees who are managers or market
analysts:
```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employee
WHERE department IN ('Manager', 'Marketing');
```
7. List employees hired in August:
```sql
SELECT name, department, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) = 8;
```
8. List employees who were hired after December 31, 2006:
```sql
SELECT name, department, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date > '2006-12-31';
```
These SQL queries should help you achieve the tasks you mentioned. Please adapt the table
structure and data as needed for your specific use case.

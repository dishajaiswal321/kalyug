Create both tables with primary key and foreign key constraints:

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    c_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    c_name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(255),
    pincode VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE Order2(
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    cust_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customer(c_id)
);
Insert 10 records into each table:

-- Inserting 10 records into the Customer table
INSERT INTO Customer (c_id, c_name, email, city, pincode)
VALUES
    (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', 'New York', '10001'),
    (2, 'Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', 'Los Angeles', '90001'),
    -- Add more records as needed.

-- Inserting 10 records into the Order table
INSERT INTO Order2(order_id, amount, cust_id)
VALUES
    (1, 100.00, 1),
    (2,  75.50, 2),
    -- Add more records as needed.
Find all orders placed by customers with cust_id 2:

SELECT * FROM Order2 WHERE cust_id = 2;
Find the list of customers who placed their orders and details of their orders:

SELECT c.c_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customer c
INNER JOIN Order2 o ON c.c_id = o.cust_id;
List of customers who haven't placed an order:

SELECT c.c_name
FROM Customer c
LEFT JOIN Order2 o ON c.c_id = o.cust_id
WHERE o.cust_id IS NULL;
List all orders and append them to the customer table:
You can't directly append the orders to the Customer table because they are separate entities. However, you can retrieve a list of all customers and their orders in a single query as shown in task 4.

Display all records:
To display all records from both tables, you can run two separate queries:


-- Display all records from the Customer table
SELECT * FROM Customer;

-- Display all records from the Order table
SELECT * FROM Order;
Display customers that are from the same city:
To display customers from the same city, you can use a self-join on the Customer table. For example, to find customers from the same city as customer 2 (Jane Smith):


SELECT c2.c_name
FROM Customer c1
INNER JOIN Customer c2 ON c1.city = c2.city
WHERE c1.c_id = 2;
This query will return a list of customers who are from the same city as Jane Smith. Adjust the c1.c_id value to check for other customers.
